# exploring-healthkit-data
Exploring some of my own healthkit data (from apple watch)

## Using github codespaces and the web editor
A secondary goal of this small project is to familiarize myself with the github web editor (github.dev) and codespaces. 
What can be done with each and what cannot. [link](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor)

I will try to only use these two tools for the project. I created the repo using the github website and I will make small edits using the web editor. I have not (yet) found the need to use codespaces but I expect to soon.
